# PPIN-ALLODYNA
## 1. Introduction of PPIN-ALLODYNA

At the structural level, the computation of biological networks, including protein structural networks and elastic network models developed in our preliminary research, has been widely applied to allosteric signaling within proteins, providing effective tools for structural biologists. In particular, the elastic network model can not only study the local energy and conformational changes of protein structures at the molecular level, but also realize the quantitative description of protein dynamics at the omics level, providing a theoretical approach for high-throughput allostery studies. Therefore, extending the method based on the elastic network model calculation to the protein-protein interaction network level can realize the global dynamics of the network or module with the functional coupling of the signaling pathways inherent to the network topology, and theoretically realize the allosteric effect at the network level.
  
PPIN-ALLODYNA (**P**rotein-**P**rotein **I**nteraction **N**etwork-**ALLO**steric **DYNA**mics) is an integrated tool for exploring methods of introducing allosteric effects based on protein structure level into the analysis of protein-protein interaction networks to construct a PPIN-based functional atlas. This tool is expected for mapping biophysical ideas and methods into the study of protein-protein interaction networks, enabling quantitative and dynamic portrayal of signaling pathways, as well as anticipating new interpretations of molecular mechanisms of disease.
  
The tool is currently being further developed and refined, and a new version will be available soon in the future.
